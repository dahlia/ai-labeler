# ü¶æüè∑Ô∏è AI Labeler

Let AI handle the labeling! 

This GitHub Action uses LLMs to label your issues and PRs, keeping your repo organized while you focus on what matters.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Smart Analysis**: Understands context from titles, descriptions, and code changes
- **Zero Config**: Works out of the box with your existing GitHub labels
- **Customizable**: Fine-tune behavior with optional configuration
- **Reliable**: Supports OpenAI and Anthropic's latest models, orchestrated with ControlFlow

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Create `.github/workflows/ai-labeler.yml`:

```yaml
name: AI Labeler

# Trigger on issues and PRs
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, reopened]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened]

jobs:
  ai-labeler:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      issues: write
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: jlowin/ai-labeler@v0.1.0
        with:
          # The default model is openai/gpt-4o-mini, which requires an OpenAI API key
          openai-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          
          # Optional: use a different model
          # controlflow-llm-model: anthropic/claude-3-sonnet-20240229
          
          # Required if using an Anthropic model:
          # anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}

          # Optional: your config file path
          # config-path: .github/ai-labeler.yml
```

2. Add your API key(s) to your repository's secrets using the same names as in your workflow file.

That's it! The AI will read your repository's existing labels and their descriptions to make smart labeling decisions. Want to improve the AI's accuracy? Just update your label descriptions in GitHub's UI.

## üéØ Fine-Tuning (Optional)

You can create a config file to provide additional instructions and control over the labeling behavior. Labels defined in the config will be created on your repository if they don't exist.

### Configuration Options

Create `.github/ai-labeler.yml` (default location; can be overridden by setting the `config-path` input) with any of these options:

- `instructions`: Overall guidance for the AI labeler
- `include_repo_labels`: Whether to include repository labels not defined in config (default: true)
- `labels`: Label definitions
  - `description`: What the label means
  - `instructions`: Detailed criteria for applying the label

Here's an example that shows some of the ways you can guide the AI's decisions:

```yaml
# Give the AI some personality and guidance
instructions: |
  You're our labeling expert! Please help keep our repository organized by:
  - Using 'bug' only for confirmed issues, not feature requests
  - Applying 'help wanted' to good first-time contributor opportunities
  - Being generous with 'good first issue' to encourage new contributors

# Define or enhance specific labels
labels:
  documentation:
    description: "Documentation changes"
    instructions: |
      Apply when changes are primarily documentation-focused:
      - Changes to README, guides, or other .md files
      - Updates to docstrings or inline documentation
      - Issues requesting clearer docs or examples
      - For PRs, look for changes in docs/ directory or .md files
        
  deps:
    description: "Dependency updates"
    instructions: |
      For changes to project dependencies:
      - Updates to requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, etc.
      - Version bumps in package configs
      - Don't apply for documentation-only dependency changes
      
  security:
    description: "Security-related changes"
    instructions: |
      High priority! Apply when:
      - Issue describes a security vulnerability
      - PR fixes a security issue
      - Changes touch security-critical code paths
      Look especially at changes in security/, auth/, or crypto/ directories

  ui:
    description: "User interface changes"
    instructions: |
      For frontend and UI-related changes:
      - Changes to HTML/CSS/JS in frontend/
      - Visual design updates
      - UX improvements
      - User-facing text changes
```
